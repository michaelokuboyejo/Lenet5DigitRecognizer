## Lenet's Digit Recognizer in Keras

This simple project is a Keras implementation (with a few architectural changes) of the famous LeCun et al., 1988 paper on Convolution Neural Networks.
The paper [LeCun et al., 1998. Gradient based learning applied to document recognition](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-98.pdf) written in 1998 was one of the earliest mentions of CNNs.

In this project, I'm targeting the [Kaggle Digit Recognizer competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data) which uses the famous MNIST data set.


# Dependencies
